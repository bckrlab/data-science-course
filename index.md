# Data Science Course Exercise Collection

This Jupyter Book is a collection of the exercise notebooks in the Data Science course held by the bckrlab at the University of Rostock.

On each exercise page, there is a rocket-shaped button in the top-right corner. Use it to open the exercise notebook in an interactive environment. There you will be able to fill in your answers and run code cells, without the need to set up Python locally on your machine.

Solutions will be distributed after each exercise session through our course in StudIP.
